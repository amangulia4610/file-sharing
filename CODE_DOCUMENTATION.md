# üìö The File Share - Comprehensive Code Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview of the extensive code documentation that has been added throughout The File Share project. Every major file now includes comprehensive comments explaining architecture, functionality, and implementation details.

## üéØ Documentation Standards Applied

### üìã Documentation Philosophy
We've implemented enterprise-level documentation standards throughout the codebase:

- **Comprehensive File Headers**: Each file begins with detailed documentation explaining purpose, features, architecture, and technical implementation
- **JSDoc-Style Function Comments**: All major functions include parameter documentation, return value descriptions, and purpose explanations
- **Section Organization**: Code is logically organized with clear section headers and separation
- **Inline Documentation**: Complex logic includes step-by-step explanations
- **State Documentation**: React state variables are thoroughly documented with purposes and data flow
- **Event Handler Documentation**: All Socket.IO and WebRTC events are explained in detail
